PROMPT :

I want to build a full-stack e-commerce website for a tailoring and clothing shop. Customers should be able to:
Buy ready-made clothes online (with categories, sizes, images, and cart/checkout).
Place custom tailoring orders by selecting designs from the shop or uploading their own, choosing fabrics, and providing measurements (both standard sizes and detailed custom measurements).
Send their own fabric for stitching and receive the finished product via delivery.
Track orders from "Order Received" to "Delivered".
Contact us via WhatsApp and view our Instagram feed directly on the site.
The site should have a frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the user interface, a backend (Python Django) to handle business logic, and a database (MySQL or SQLite) to store products, customers, and orders.
I will use VS Code for development, host it on PythonAnywhere or Hostinger, and connect a custom domain.
The project should include a home page, product pages, a custom tailoring form, a services page, a gallery, an order tracking system, and a contact page. It must be mobile-friendly, secure, and easy to update.
